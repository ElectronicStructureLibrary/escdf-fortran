System Reading and Writing Examples
===================================

The programs found in this directory are provided first to help developers
use the SCDF libraries within their codes. The data produced by running
them, namely a simple NaCl crystal, is not especially interesting in itself.
NaCl has been chosen because it is easy to check the validity of the data
and understand the contents of the corresponding ESCDF files.

To build the programs, just type 'make'.

In order to ensure the consistency of the data, all the write_* examples
should be run before the read_* ones, since the latter will expect ESCDF
files generated by the former.

Concretely, this means:

  1. Run the write_system_metadata program.
  2. Run the read_system_metadata program.

To better understand what these simple programs do, you are strongly
encouraged to study their contents.
